           <p><h>Overview</h></p>
<p>A design for the pilot website of Boston AI Labs: a startup company that designs AI technology to detect and combat Retinopathy of Prematurity in newborn infants. This disease, dubbed ROP, is one of the leading causes of blindness in newborn infants.</p>
<p><h>My Task</h></p>
<p>I was contacted by Degang Wang of Boston AI Labs to design their website from scratch, as the company did not use a website at the time.
I was given very few guidelines, the only requirement being that the company's solution to ROP is clearly advertised. I was given numerous numerous resources from which to cull for information about ROP.</p>
<p><h>Design Goals</h></p>
<p>I concluded that the primary goals of this project should be: 
1) Given verbose blocks of information about the disease, display them to the reader in a condensed, easily digestible format.

2) Allow the company's solution to ROP to be clearly presented to the reader.</p>
<p><h>Design Process</h></p>
<p>I decided to approach these goals by conducting a competitive analysis of the websites associated with prominent medical companies, and creating a table to gauge the features employed by the websites to: 
1) Present the medical problem that the company aims to combat 
and 
2) Present and market the company's solution to the problem. </p>

-----------------------

<p><h>Competitive Analysis</h></p>
<p>I investigated the websites of similar companies who are also developing medical AI solutions for eye diseases. I then synthesized my investigation into a table of key features. 
This abbreviated table consists of features found in at least 2 of the 3 websites. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The websites referenced are <a href="https://www.eyenuk.com/us-en/">EYENUK</a>, <a href="https://www.digitaldiagnostics.com/products/eye-disease/idx-dr/">Digital Diagnostics</a>, and <a href="https://pr3vent.com/website/index.php">PR3VENT</a>.</p>

<p><h>Wireframe</h></p>
<p>With these key features in mind, I then proceeded to create a wireframe sketch integrating the key features while presenting the problem of ROP alongside the Boston AI Labs solution. </p>

<p><h>Prototypes and Conclusion</h></p>
<p>Through further discussion, we were then able to devise low and high fidelity prototypes. To bring the prototypes to life, we settled on a simple blue color scheme to match the logo of Boston AI Labs. </p>
