          <p> Currently I work as a Mobile Developer for Brown University's Center for Computation and Visualization. I am working on the frontend of an app called Soma. This app enables users to track chronic pain. </p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>I integrate React Native and JavaScript to develop the frontend of this app, referencing a high fidelity prototype designed in Adobe XD. </p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>The repository and high-fidelity prototype are private. A link to the app will be posted as soon as it goes live!</p>

<p><b><u>Full Internship Description:</u></b></p>
<p>In this internship, I work alongside other designers, developers and researchers to coordinate the development of the app Soma. This app enables users to track chronic pain. I participate in weekly meetings to discuss project goals, progress, and scope of work, providing feedback pertaining to the User Experience journey associated with the app, user testing, and IRB drafting, documentation, and approval. I also analyze the Adobe Xd files in which the app was designed and drafted, and bring the static design to life using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, within the React Native coding framework (a version of React optimized for mobile development). Specifically, I code components that can be found throughout the app and organize the components on the app screen, ensuring that the components are customizable so that they can be reused. I submit my work for review and approval from fellow developers. I also review coding submissions from developers and provide feedback. Throughout the process, I am required to make informed design decisions regarding color, layout, readability and other visual aspects to ensure an optimal User Experience journey. I am also required to research and learn the implementation of certain visual features in React (for example, animations), so that they can be integrated into the development of the app as components.</p>

<p><b><u>Review after one semester:</u></b></p>
<p>Throughout this semester I have enjoyed the honor of working with many amazing designers, developers, and researchers working at the Center for Computation and Visualization. I worked under the guidance of Ellen Duong and Bradford Roarr, two research software engineers. Through weekly meetings and check-ins, they helped me to perfect my GitHub and React competencies so that I was able to code functional components and integrate them into user-responsive screens illuminating the different capabilities of the app Soma. Throughout this process, I was able to gain experience with the transcription from static components of an Adobe Xd file to interactive modules accessed via mobile app, within the boundaries posed by the React Native Framework. In response to the tasks I was assigned, I performed extensive research regarding means to correctly implement the designs from the Xd file, which were not originally created with the React Native library in mind as the instrument of their creation. In some cases, the desired implementation strategy was left open-ended. In these cases, I was required to make informed design decisions to bring the specificities to life. During these processes, I prioritized user accessibility while also paying homage to the trademark appearance of the app.</p>
